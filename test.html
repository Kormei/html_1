    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>I have two siblings; I have a sister named Karoline and a brother named Jaxon. My parents' names are Clark and Krystle. Our family hails from Conway, Arkansas.</p>
    <strong>My siblings drive me crazy!!!</strong> I'd really like to <em>emphasize</em> that point.
    <p>Also heres a photo of my Australian Shepherd (I do actually have an Australian Shepherd--this photo was just taken from Google though)</p>
